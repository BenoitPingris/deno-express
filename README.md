# Deno express

Tried to recreate `express` framework with `Deno` using the basic http server provided by `Deno`.
This is just for fun !

## Todo

- [ ] Middleware aware of the route status
- [ ] Nested routes
- [ ] Render file (ejs)
- [ ] Server static files
- [ ] Handle params & query params

## What's working ?
- [x] Serve HTTP methods like `GET POST DELETE PATCH PUT`
- [x] Basic middleware functionalities
- [x] Read incomming body
- [x] Send data back to the client
